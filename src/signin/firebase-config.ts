/**
 * @fileoverview Firebase's configuration for the JS SDK, by where an app runs.
 *
 * - **iOS and Android** are configured from the app's Google services files
 *   (`GoogleService-Info.plist`, `google-services.json`), never environment
 *   variables. The files are bundled with the app and safe in source control:
 *   each names the app's bundle ID, and the native SDK checks the running app
 *   matches it. Native Firebase (`@react-native-firebase/app`) reads them at
 *   launch and exposes what it read as `getApp().options`; the JS SDK (auth)
 *   is initialised from those. Android's Google *web* client id — what makes
 *   Google return an ID token there — is not among the options, so it is
 *   read from `google-services.json`, which the app `require`s.
 * - **The web, macOS and Windows** are Firebase *web apps*: Firebase has no
 *   desktop platform, and a web app's configuration carries no bundle ID. The
 *   app builds a {@link FirebaseWebConfig} from its environment variables and
 *   passes it in. Of its fields, `projectId`, `storageBucket` and
 *   `messagingSenderId` are the project's, `apiKey` and `authDomain` are
 *   shared by all of its web apps, and `appId` and `measurementId` belong to
 *   one web app — so the web, macOS and Windows each have their own.
 *
 * Native modules and files are injected; auth_lib names no native package and
 * reads no environment.
